As an international student in the USA, I have discovered a passion for coding and technology. I enjoy keeping up with the latest tech trends and conducting research to deepen my understanding of new technologies. My ultimate goal is to become a software engineer and work with teams to plan and execute successful projects. In my personal life, I am also interested in combining technology with business to help my family grow.

Hi, I'm an international student in USA whose is finding his path in life through coding. I love to check for techs new and do some research to understand about them.
I'm looking forward to be a software engineer in the future, where i would make plans for projects and work with teams to success in it. My personal usage with coding is combining
Technology with business to help with my family growth.
